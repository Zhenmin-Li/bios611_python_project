\section{Content}

As I mentioned in project 1, I used the dataset from Kaggle and the size is not enough for analysis. In this project I use tweepy to parse tweets from Trump. The size is stil limited becasue I use a free API. A paid one can do it better with the same script.
\\ \hspace*{\fill} \\ 
This project is a seperate one because I don't need rscripts from project 1. I did some sentiment analysis different from project 1 and generated a line chart.
\\ \hspace*{\fill} \\ 
In this project I use a different sentiment analysis method in textblob. This product polarity and subject as two elements.
